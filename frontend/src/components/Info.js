          <h1 className='text'>"ABOUT ZACK VALIS"</h1>
          <p className='text'>My name is Zack and I am a skilled
          Software Developer currently based out of Charlotte,
          North Carolina. I specialize in Data Science and Web
          Development, but I am always willing and eager to learn
          more in order to grow my skills.
          I graduated from USC Upstate in 2020
          with a BS in Computer Science and went back to school
          in 2022 to earn a certificate in Data Analytics from
          UNC Charlotte.
          I'm a well rounded person who loves the
          intersection between form and function.
          When developing this website, I tirelessly blended the
          two and took great inspiration from hip hop
          and streetwear culture in order to make the vision I had
          for my website a reality.
          </p>
          <p className='text'>Some of my personal interests: I'm a big sports guy who likes to
          watch football, basketball, and Formula 1. I also have a
          couple cars that I like to work on, maintain, and customize.
          I am currently rebuilding my 2012 Subaru STi hatch to make
          roughly 400whp and plan one day to make my 1990 Miata into
          a WTAC compliant racecar. I also like to dabble in fashion,
          primarily wearing streewear brands and have a small, but
          growing sneaker collection. In 2017/2018, while studying
          abroad in Germany, I started to get into photography and
          continue to play around with different cameras and angles
          only using natural lighting with little to no
          post-processing.</p>
